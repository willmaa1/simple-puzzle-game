# Simple puzzle

Simple puzzle game with pure JavaScript. Uses canvas to crop images for each piece.

## Usage

Use any server to host the files. CORS prevents from just opening index.html directly in a browser.

## Playing

The pieces will snap to connect to each other and connected pieces move together. Sound cue is played when snapping.

Note! Currently snapping is only checked for the piece you are moving, not any of the connected pieces.
